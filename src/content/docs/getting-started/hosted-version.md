title: Using the Hosted Version
---

ChatLima's hosted version provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with various AI models. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

## Sidebar

The sidebar, which can be collapsed or expanded, contains several navigation and control elements:

*   **New Chat:** Click this button to start a new conversation.
*   **Search chats...:** This search box allows you to find saved chats by searching for keywords in their titles.
*   **Saved Chats List:** Below the search box, you'll find a list of your previously saved conversations.
*   **MCP Servers:** This menu relates to adding, editing, deleting, activating, deactivating MCP Servers ( Model Context Protocol).
*   **Theme:** Allows you to customize the appearance of the application, for example, by switching between light and dark modes.
*   **Profile Menu:** Access your user profile and related settings.

## Main Window

The main window is where your conversations take place.

*   At the top, you'll find a **collapse button** for the sidebar and another **New Chat button**.
*   The central area displays the current chat.
*   At the bottom, the **"Send a message..."** input field is where you type your messages, prompts, or questions.
*   **Model Picker:** To the left of the send button (or near the message input area), you can select the AI model you wish to use for the conversation.
*   **Send Button:** An arrow icon, typically on the right of the message input field, sends your message.
*   **Web Enabled Feature:** A world icon toggles the web-enabled feature. When active, ChatLima uses your prompt or message to search the web and incorporate that information into its response.
